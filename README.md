- [`week01-linear-regression`](./week01-linear-regression/) – What is ML + build your first model

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of Week 1, you'll understand linear regression and build your first ML model from scratch.

**Current Content:**
- **Day 1:** Python basics (variables, lists, loops, functions, NumPy)
- **Day 2:** Math foundations (lines, slope, predictions, error)
- **Day 3+:** Coming soon...

## 🚀 Quick Start

**How to use this course:**

### Step 1: Fork & Clone (Recommended)

This allows you to save your work and submit solutions!

```bash
# 1. Fork this repository on GitHub (click "Fork" button)

# 2. Clone YOUR fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/zero-to-ml.git
cd zero-to-ml

# 3. Create your student folder
mkdir -p students/YOUR-NAME/week01
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Environment

| Method | Best For | Setup |
|--------|----------|-------|

# In your cloned folder:
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter ipykernel

# Open in VS Code
code .

# Open week01-linear-regression/01-python-primer.ipynb
```

### GitHub Codespaces
1. On YOUR forked repo, click `Code` → `Codespaces` → `Create codespace`
2. Wait for VS Code to load in browser
3. Open `week01-linear-regression/01-python-primer.ipynb`

### Google Colab
1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. `File` → `Open notebook` → `GitHub` → Enter YOUR fork URL
